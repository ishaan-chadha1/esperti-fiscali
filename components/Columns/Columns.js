        review: `I recently had the pleasure of working with Shweta, an exceptional empowerment coach, to gain clarity in building my business and making crucial career choices. Throughout our sessions, Shweta provided insightful guidance and unwavering support, which were instrumental in helping me gain the clarity I needed.

With Shwetaâ€™s expertise, I am able to feel more assured about my career choice. Moreover, Shweta helped me acknowledge and celebrate my achievements, which boosted my self-esteem and motivation.

I highly recommend Shweta to anyone seeking direction and empowerment in their professional and personal life. The positive impact of these sessions has been transformative, and I am grateful for the clarity and confidence I have gained to follow my path.`,

        review: `The journey of more and more awareness, knowing exactly what would contribute most, opening up the question within to unlock the choices and possibilities. Applying the most relevant way of choosing ourselves in each situation, that's what working with Shweta Chadha has been like ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

And of course, more ease, less judgments with projection and expectation free awareness - is the magic I've so kindly been gifted by her. Immensely grateful to her and the universe for arranging the classes to co-create the greater magical me ðŸ˜˜`,
